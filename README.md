# New-York-Airbnb-Price-Prediction
Airbnb is an online-based marketing company that connects people looking for accommodation (Airbnb guests) to people looking to rent their properties (Airbnb hosts) on a short-term or long-term basis.

Airbnb generates tons of data including but not limited to: density of rentals across regions (cities and neighborhoods), price variations across rentals, host-guest interactions in the form of reviews.

The goals of this projects are to answer questions such as: 
(i) how are rental properties distributed across the neighborhoods of NYC (there are 221 neighborhoods).

(ii) how do prices vary with respect neighborhoods, rental property types and rental amenities.

(iii) more importantly, how well can machine learning models be trained to predict Airbnb rental prices using features such as rental property type, the number of people a rental can accommodate, the number of available beds, and so forth.
